# CIDER
C IDE R-something (just thought the name would be cool)

The goal of this project is to 
1 - Create an IDE for C-language which is entirely functional, with compiler, debugger, text editor...
2 - Learn to use Go programming language

The entirerity of the project will be done in Go (except maybe the configuration files), and I'm using fyne for the user interface
